[OS.BF---THE OS TO LAST

OS.bf is the project to get operating systems to an effective minimum
of features. It's written entirely in Brainfuck, an industry standard
in minimal, portable, architecture-independent, axiomatic
technology. The features of OS.bf are:
 - Portability: runs everywhere Brainfuck does and requires only cell
   wrapping from the implementation it runs on.
 - Textuality: has only one interaction medium---the command line. No
   bloated GUIs, no weird keymaps, just the text.
 - Simplicity: has a small set of commands and file operations that
   cover all the needs of a modern computer user.
 - Scriptability: can run arbitrary Brainfuck code on the data it
   has. This allows for infinite use cases.
 - Extensibility: just copy-paste the files and operations you need
 into the OS.bf code, restart---and you have your files always with
 you!

 [1 RATIONALE

  The operating system world is in dire need of disruptionâ€”most OSes (OS
  X, Windows), and even most Linux distributions (bundling GNOME by
  default) look alike and have bloated sets of programs that are slow,
  painful to build, and behavior-wise inconsistent across the system.

  OS.bf solves these problems by going back to the minimal set of things
  OS should have: a text UI, file system, and script execution. Using
  the merits of Brainfuck as the most embeddable and portable
  programming language, the system is easy to install and launch, having
  the Brainfuck implementation as the only dependency and being as fast
  as the implementation allows it. OS.bf is a single-user,
  single-process, and single-environment system. There's only one
  user---the one launching the system. There's only one process---the
  one OS.bf and its scripts run in. There's only one
  environment---Brainfuck image memory, shared by all the scripts.

  This radical simplicity allows OS.bf to squeeze maximal power out of a
  minimal interface. Try and see for yourself!]

 [2 EXAMPLE USAGE

  Here's a small session recording to get you started with the features OS.bf has:
  ======================================
  # Create a file called HELLO with contents "Hello, OS.bf!":
  s HELLO Hello, OS.bf!
  # List all the files:
  l
  HELLO
  # Print the contents of the HELLO file:
  p HELLO
  Hello, OS.bf!
  # Run a script adding 1 to every char in HELLO and printing it:
  r <<<+[-<+]->[+.>]
  Ifmmp-!PT/cg"
  # delete HELLO:
  d HELLO
  # List the files again to see if the file was actually deleted:
  l
  # Exit OS.bf:
  q
